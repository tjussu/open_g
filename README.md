# OpenG Project

__Currently, the project is in the prototyping phase.__

## Overview

The goal of this project is to develop an open-source data logger for soaring and glider aerobatics. The hardware can be built by anyone interested and modified for their own purposes.

## Goals
Specific implementation goals are:

- A watchdog for structural load factors:
    - The load factors are measured in correspondence with the flight envelope (speed & load factors).
    - Critical events will be saved to memory.
    - The load factors can be displayed on a module.
- Path tracing for aerobatics:
    - Tracking of the flight path for training evaluation.
- Easy construction:
    - No difficult-to-solder SMD parts.
    - PCB can be ordered from an online EMS.
    - 3D-printable casing.
    - Construction cost under 450 â‚¬.
    - Easy modification.
- Documentation:
    - Hardware documentation.
    - Software documentation.
    - User manual.
    - Technical reference.


We aim to design the hardware in such a way that the system is compliant with EASA regulations. 

## Collaboration
The project is part of a master's thesis conducted at the _Dortmund University of Applied Sciences and Arts_ in cooperation with the _Luftsportfreunde 2000 Kamen/Dortmund club_.

Thanks to both!


## Future Updates
Further information will be provided in the near future.
